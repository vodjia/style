# Coding Style

This repository is a collection of my own coding styles.

## Introduction

Coding style plays an important role in maintaining projects.
Different projects may choose different styles, and there is no right or wrong.
For some languages, such as Java and Rust, there is an official coding style accepted by most developers, so please just use it.
For other languages, such as C, C++, Python, and so on, either there is no official coding style, or the official recommendation is not widely accepted.
In those cases, developers are usually allowed to make their own choices.
Therefore, I decided to write some of my own coding styles for others and me to refer.
